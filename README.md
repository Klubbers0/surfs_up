## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this anlysis was to look at temperature trends for June and December. Temperatures trends for both months were needed to see if a surf shop in Hawaii is a sustainable business model year round according to temperatures for surfing. 

##Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.


* The average temperature for June taken from data from June 2010 through June 2016 is 74 degrees, while the minimum temperature from the same data set is 64 degrees, as can be seem by the below image.

* The average temperature for December taken from data from December 2019 through December 2016 is 71 degrees, while the minimum temperature from the same data set, is 56 degrees. This can be seen in the below image.

* The average temperature is higher for the month of June by 3 degrees, which is expected as June is typically a warm summer month. December has a lower temperature as that is a winter month, and typically is colder. 

## Summary
Average temperatures seem to be pretty close in June and December, however there is no way of knowing when this data was collected. Temperatures from the morning, evening and afternoon can vary wildly from day to day. I would suggest gathering and creating queries for three more sets of data. Temperatures to be taken once in the morning, once in the evening and again at night, and comparing those.
